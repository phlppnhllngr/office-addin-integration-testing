### Description
This repository contains instructions on and an example for integration testing (end-to-end testing) Office Add-ins in a production-like environment using Appium, WinAppDriver and Node.js.<br/>
No running the app inside a standalone web browser and/or mocking the Office.js-API.<br/>
The example Add-in is the "office-addin-taskpane-js" for Word generated by yeoman generator-office (version 1.2.4). 

### Requirements
- Windows 10, user with admin privileges
- Microsoft Word

### Instructions
1) [Enable *developer mode*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) in Windows.
2) [Download](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) and install the *Windows SDK*.
3) [Download](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver/releases) and install *Windows Application Driver (WinAppDriver, WAD)*. The WAD version must be compatible with the installed version of *Appium*. Appium v1.13.0 works with WAD v1.1.
4) ```git clone``` this repository.
5) Run ```npm install``` to fetch and install the required dependencies. The *windows-build-tools* postinstall script requires this command to be executed in an administrative PowerShell. Yo (yeoman) and generator-office are included in package.json for documentation purposes only and can be skipped.
6) Start the development web server for the add-in and Appium by running ```npm run servers```.
7) Run ```npm run e2e``` in another shell to sideload the add-in into Word and execute the test suite defined in index.js.
8) The code comments in index.js contain more information on how to obtain element selectors etc.
